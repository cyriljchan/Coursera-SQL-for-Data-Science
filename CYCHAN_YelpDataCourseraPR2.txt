Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 entries
ii. Business table = 10000 entries
iii. Category table = 10000 entries
iv. Checkin table = 10000 entries
v. elite_years table = 10000 entries
vi. friend table = 10000 entries
vii. hours table = 10000 entries
viii. photo table = 10000 entries
ix. review table = 10000 entries
x. tip table = 10000 entries
xi. user table = 10000 entries
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 distinct entries (id)
ii. Hours = 1562 distinct entries (business_id)
iii. Category = 2643 distinct entries (business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115 distinct entries (business_id)
v. Review = 10000 distinct entries (id), 8090 distinct entries (business_id), 9581 distinct entries (user_id)
vi. Checkin = 493 distinct entries (business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000 distinct entries (id), 6493 distinct entries (business_id)
viii. Tip = 537 distinct entries (user_id), 3979 distinct entries (business_id)
ix. User = 10000 distinct entries (id)
x. Friend = 11 distinct entries (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 distinct entries (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

CHOSEN CITY : Mississauga

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes. The higher rated businesses seem to open during the afternoons and close at night (around 12H operations) while the lower rated businesses open in the mornings and close at midnight (more than 12H operations)


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes. It seems that the higher rated businesses have more than 60 reviews while the lower rated businsses have less than 30 reviews
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Nothing significant as the area of the groups overlap with each other.

SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT *
FROM business b
INNER JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
WHERE b.city = 'Mississauga'
GROUP BY h.hours
ORDER BY b.name

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
Open businesses generally have more star ratings than closed businesses.

GROUP BY stars

SELECT is_open

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Sentiment analysis on the given reviews based on certain keywords in them and output whether a given review is Positive or Negative.          
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
I would only need to obtain the text of the review and based on the keywords I set then output whether the review is a Positive or Negative review.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+-------------------------------------+-----------------+-------+--------------+-----------------+
